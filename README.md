# CMDAnimator
For my project proposal, I would like to create a text command animation program using javafx
which allows the user to create basic animations. This will allow the user to create small
animated movies using their own image files and text to add to a stage. In order for the user to do
this, they will have to write commands into the command line given in the GUI and press enter. Upon
clicking enter, the userâ€™s command, such as adding an image to a particular part of the screen, will be
executed and the image will be added to the screen. The user will also be able to add more frames, by
typing in a command, which simply adds a new blank screen. Then the user can add more images to
the new frame. When they are done, they can play the animation, and the program will play each
frame, one by one, based on the frames per second specified. This gives the illusion of a moving
object, i.e. animation. 

To run: just compile/run the main.java file in src/ccmdAnimator/main.java
