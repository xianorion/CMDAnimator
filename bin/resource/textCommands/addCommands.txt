Add Frame --- Calls add frame function
Add Image “image.gif” (Point.x,Point.y) ---Calls addImage function with parameters: “Image.gif” and (Point.x,Point.y) so image will be added to the screen at point.x and point.y
Add Image “image.gif” (Point.x,Point.y) HEIGHT WIDTH ---Calls addImage function with parameters: “Image.gif” and (Point.x,Point.y) and the height for the image to add along with the width
NOTE: the number for height must be between 0 and 300, whilst the width must be between 0 and 600
Add Text “Hello world” (Point.x,Point.y) --- Calls addText function with parameters: “Hello world” and (Point.x, Point.y)

You can either add an image, text, or a frame to the animation. To add a frame you must say “Add frame”.
To add an image you must say “add image” followed by the path to the image and the point where you want to place the image on the screen. With the default height and width being 50.
Also, if you would like to specify the height and width of image, you must say "add image" followed by the path to the image, the point where you want to place the image on the screen, the height of the image as a whole number (no decimals) and the width as a whole number.
To add text you must say “add text” followed by the text you want to add surrounded in quotation marks like: “text I want to add”
And lastly, you must add the point on the screen you want to text to be placed.

The point must be in the format (x,y) where x is the x-coordinate on the canvas, and y the y-coordinate. Example: (45,32) will add a text and/or image to x-coordinate 45 and y-coordinate 32 on the graph.
