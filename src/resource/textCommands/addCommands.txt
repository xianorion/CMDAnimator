You can either add an image, text, or a frame to the animation. To add a frame you must say “Add frame”.
To add an image you must say “add image” followed by the path to the image and the point where you want to place the image on the screen.
To add text you must say “add text” followed by the text you want to add surrounded in quotation marks like: “text I want to add”
And lastly, you must add the point on the screen you want to text to be placed.

The point must be in the format (x,y) where x is the x-coordinate on the canvas, and y the y-coordinate. Example: (45,32) will add a text and/or image to x-coordinate 45 and y-coordinate 32 on the graph.
